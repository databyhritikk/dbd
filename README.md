💻 What is Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)?
Think of EC2 as a virtual computer (server) you can rent from Amazon. You can use it to host websites, run apps, process data—whatever a real computer can do.

It's in the cloud, so no need to buy hardware.

You can choose how powerful it should be (CPU, RAM, etc.).

You pay only for how long you use it (like paying per minute/hour for a hotel room).

🧱 What is an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)?
An AMI is like a blueprint or recipe for your EC2 instance.

It includes the operating system (Linux, Windows, etc.) and any software you want.

You choose an AMI when launching an EC2 instance.

You can even make your own AMI and reuse it to launch other servers with the exact same setup—like making multiple cakes from the same recipe.

🧩 What Makes Up an EC2 Instance?
An EC2 instance is made up of:

vCPU (virtual processor)

Memory (RAM)

Network capacity

Storage

Optional: GPU for graphics-heavy tasks

You choose the right mix depending on your app needs.

🏷️ What Is an Instance Type and Family?
AWS offers different instance types—like phone models (iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, etc.):

Each instance type has:

A family (based on purpose)

A size (small, medium, large, etc.)

Example:
c5.large

c5: compute-optimized family (good for CPU-heavy tasks)

large: how powerful the instance is

🔥 Instance Families (Categories):
Family	Purpose	Example Use
General	Balanced	Web servers, dev
Compute-optimized	CPU-heavy	Gaming, ML, batch processing
Memory-optimized	RAM-heavy	Databases, analytics
Accelerated	GPU-heavy	Video rendering, 3D apps
Storage-optimized	Fast local storage	NoSQL DBs, analytics

🌐 Where Does an EC2 Instance Live?
When you launch an instance:

It's placed in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)—think of it as its own private network.

It also sits in an Availability Zone (AZ)—a data center in a specific region.

👉 Tip: Use at least 2 AZs for high availability (if one fails, the other works).

🔁 EC2 Instance Lifecycle (How It Works)
Pending – AWS is setting things up.

Running – The instance is live, and you're getting billed.

Reboot – Like restarting your laptop.

Stop – Temporarily shut down (RAM is lost).

Stop-Hibernate – Save RAM data so you can resume where you left off.

Terminate – Shut down forever (data and IPs are gone).

💸 Pricing Explained Simply
You only pay for what you use:

Charged per second (not per hour like in the past).


Testing/development

Jobs that can handle sudden interruptions

🧠 Real-Life Analogy
EC2 Instance = A rented computer

You choose the power (CPU, RAM), OS (Linux/Windows), and storage.

You can pause (stop) or delete it (terminate) anytime.

You can choose to pay more for uninterrupted usage or save money with flexible, riskier options like Spot.
